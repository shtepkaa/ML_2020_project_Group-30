\textbf{Machine Learning 2020 course} organized by \textit{Skolkovo University of Science and Technology}

In our report, we replicated algorithm BHT-ARIMA proposing in the paper ``Block Hankel Tensor ARIMA for Multiple Short Time Series Forecasting". This method used for multivariate time-series (TS) forecasting using Hankelization and Tucker Decomposition. We measured the forecasting accuracy using the Normalized Root Mean Error metric. In time series forecasting topic BHT-ARIMA method performs strong results compare with traditional benchmarks (ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, DeepAR, etc).


## Getting Started
